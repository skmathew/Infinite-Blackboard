    <string-array name="velocity">
        <item>Welcome! I would like to help you better understand Constant Velocity.</item>
        <item>Lets start with the definition of velocity.</item>
        <item>We say that velocity is defined as distance over time.</item>
        <item>Of course we mean the distance traveled over the time it takes to get there. So it\'s a change of time.</item>
        <item>We will see why it\'s important to think in terms of "the change of" in the definition when we talk about acceleration.</item>
        <item>Now, this certainly one way of defining velocity, but there is another way of saying the same thing.</item>
        <item>We could also say that the distance traveled is proportional to the time of travel, and velocity is the proportionality constant.</item>
        <item>Thinking of distance as the product of velocity and time allows us to visualize this idea with a picture we can draw on the blackbord.</item>
        <item>Let\'s start with trying to think about velocity in a different direction.</item>
        <item>Let\'s think of velocity as going upward. It\'s like the faster you go, the higher we are on the vertical axis.</item>
        <item>And then we think of time as going ogg to the right.</item>
        <item>Let\'s start with trying to think about velocity in a different direction.</item>
        <item>We can visualize all three things in just one picture drawn in two dimensions. Just as length as length times height is area in real space, velocity times time is distance in this particular way of looking at it.</item>
        <item>Let\'s look at an example. Suppose you are going 60 miles an hour. Of course that means you will go 60 miles in 60 minutes.</item>
        <item>... or one mile for each minute. Most people know that 60 miles per hour is also one mile per minute.</item>
        <item>But did you know that 60 miles per hour is also 88 feet per second?</item>
        <item>Anyway, we can think of this same velocity in terms of different distances...</item>
        <item>...depending on time. In a second you travel 88 feet.</item>

    <string name="question">
        A particle is moving around in a circle and its position is given in polar coordinates as x = Rcosθ, and y = Rsinθ, where R is the radius of the circle, and θ is in radians. From these equations derive the equation for centripetal acceleration.

        What is the displacement of the cross-country team if they begin at the school, run 10 miles and finish back at the school?

    <string name="speed1">
        In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position).

    </string>

    <string name="SpeedQuestion">

    </string>

    <string name="velocity1">
        Velocity is the rate of change of the displacement,Δx. It is the difference between the final and initial position of an object.

    <string name="VelocityQuestion">

    </string>

    <string name="acceleration1">
        Speed and velocity only deal with movement at a constant rate. When we speed up, slow down, or change direction, we want to know our acceleration.
    </string>

    <string name="acceleration2">
        "Acceleration, in physics, is the rate of change of velocity of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newton's Second Law."

    <string name="accelerationQuestion">
        A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly over a time of 5.21 seconds for a distance of 110 m. Determine the acceleration of the car.

    <string name="twod_motion1">
        2-dimensional motion is just like 1-dimensional motion, but with two directions to consider instead of just one! With 2D motion, we must now consider both horizontal motion and vertical motion at the same time! This is often portrayed through projectile motion. Projectile motion is when an object is traveling in freefall, but is also traveling horizontally simultaneously. A projectile\'s velocity changes in the vertical direction, but remains constant in the horizontal direction.
    </string>

    <string name="twod_motion2">
        A very common example of this is shooting a cannonball out of a cannon. The path of the cannonball often follows a parabolic path that not only travels vertically, but horizontally as well! We\'ll be using the four kinematic equations to determine the displacement, time, velocity, or acceleration at any given moment during the projectile\'s motion.
    </string>

    <string name="twod_motionQuestion">
        If a cannonball has an initial velocity of 860 m/s, what distance away does the cannonball hit the ground when shot from the cannon at a 45 degree angle with the horizontal?
